Problem Statement

Small restaurants often have a hard time keeping track of daily transactions. They also struggle with figuring out which dishes are popular and when sales peak. Manual ways of doing this can get really tedious. Plus, they lead to plenty of mistakes along the way. Thing is, there is a real need for a straightforward tool. It should help log sales data easily. It needs to summarize performance without much hassle. And it ought to visualize the biggest transactions of the day. All of that comes without any complicated setup at all.

Scope of the Project

This project offers a command-line tool aimed right at restaurant staff. They can use it to enter details for each transaction. That includes the dish sold, the amount charged, the order type, and the hour it happened. The tool counts up dish popularity on its own. It also tracks order modes, like online versus offline. Then it calculates the total revenue for the whole day. It even identifies the four-hour time blocks with the largest single transactions. Right away, users get to see a visual summary. That shows up as a simple bar chart for quick reference.

The system works just for a single day at a time. It keeps things simple and user-friendly from start to finish. It does not save data over multiple days. And it runs fine without any internet connection needed.

Target Users

Small restaurant owners and their staff make up the main group. They want fast insights into daily business operations. But they do not need complicated systems to get there. Students and learners in computer science or data analytics fit in too. They look for hands-on examples of Python programming. And they appreciate practical demos of data visualization techniques.

High-level Features

The tool uses interactive prompts to guide transaction data entry. It handles automatic totals for revenue without extra effort. Popular dishes get tallied up the same way. Order type breakdowns happen automatically as well. Peak transaction analysis covers three main time blocks. Those run from zero to four hours, four to eight hours, and eight to twelve hours. Users see a colorful bar chart output right there. It makes everything easy to understand at a glance. The whole thing runs on any computer that has Python and Matplotlib installed. No special skills come into play at all.
